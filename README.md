# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

This weeks project was to build a mobile apps with React Native. We were able to chose between three areas: sensors, api & sharing and multiscreen/navigation.

## The problem
In the beginning I wanted to do a shake-app but changed my mind due to time issues (that's why the project is still in that branch).
So I decided to go for the: Multiscreen / Navigation instead and reuse the movie API from weeks 12 movie project. The first thing I did was to fetch the API so I saw that my code and API worked. When that was set I added the main page components and details component. I decided to use Bottom Tab Navigator and added 3 differens URL:S to navigate between (Top Rated, Popular and Christmas movies). After all that was done I began with styling.  

This week I have used and read https://reactnavigation.org/ to get the app working. I found a little bit troubling in the beginning with Expo becuse I couldn't see my app in my phone, but solved it in the end by updating a lot of dependcies.
